Best: Heap sort because it is linearithmic, a lot faster,
takes up less memory and allows for fast manipulations

Then is mergesort, because it is also linearithmic, however
it takes up more memory since new arrays have to be stored

Next is comparable sort, since it is quadratic but can take
any object type and will automatically sort lexicographically 
as well.

Next is the ordinary insertion sort.

Worst: Binary insert, because it is quadratic in the worst case
and takes a lot of time finding the element to insert.
